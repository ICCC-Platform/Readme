This file includes electricity demand profiles for 200 households randomly selected among the ones available in the 2009 RECS data set for the Midwest region of the United States. The profiles have been generated using the modeling proposed by Muratori et al. [2], [3], that produces realistic patterns of residential power consumption, validated using metered data, with a resolution of 10 minutes. Households vary in size and number of occupants and the profiles represent total electricity use, in watts. This data set is provided in support of a forthcoming paper: "Impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle charging on residential power demand."
